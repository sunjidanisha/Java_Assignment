## Problem-Solving Highlights

This project features solutions to various Java programming assignments, covering a wide range of topics:

**Search and Sorting Algorithms**: Identify the 2nd highest CGPA, implement binary search, and perform manual sorting.
- **Random Number Operations**: Generate random numbers and determine minimum/maximum values.
- **Pattern Printing**: Programmatically create complex output patterns.
- **String Manipulations**: Count words, characters, vowels, and consonants; remove vowels from strings.
- **Custom Algorithms**: Break down currency notes, validate IP addresses, and verify binary strings.
- **HTML Parsing**: Extract transaction IDs using string operations.
- **Password Generation**: Generate secure passwords following custom rules.
- **Mathematical Operations**: Solve logical problems such as distributing question marks and calculating discounts.
